For this project I decided upon making an app to save a list of your favorite Ghilbi movies and being able to update/make notes on such lists as long as they are in your favorites list.

The technologies used to create this app include axios, express, ejs, javascript, css, bcrypt, and html. If you attempt to fork and clone this repository you will need to run an install of the technologies before you can add/build anything to this application.

To start this application you will have to signup using the signup form on the site. Once complete log in with your credentials.

Once logged in the site will populate with Ghilbi movies that you can add to your favorites list. You can hover over the images and a blue shadow should appear over the image indicating you can click on it.

Once the image is clicked a screen with the movie's description and rating should appear. A button stating add to favorites should be found to the right of the movie image. 

If "Add to Favorites" is clicked it will automatically take you to the favorites list that you created and allow you to update the selection with your own notes/updated title if you so choose.

**Future Considerations:

I would love to add a couple more features to this app such as a comment section as well as a rating system where each user can rate the movie based on how they felt about it. I tried to keep this app as simple as possible for the criteria of this project.
