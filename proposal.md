For my project I have decided to build an anime collection app where you can save a list of favorites and gain access to their streaming links.


Below is the link for my wireframes.

My app will have a log in page, a page with thumbnails that include animes to watch, and also a page that leads you to a link and description as to where to find the anime.


User Stories.
As a user I want to be able to access links to my favorite animes quickly.

As a user I want to be able to rate an anime that I watch so I can reccommend or not reccommend certain ones to other people.

As a user I want to be able to search for animes I might want to watch.
